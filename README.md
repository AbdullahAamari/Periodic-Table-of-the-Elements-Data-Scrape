# Comprehensive Periodic Table of the Elements Scrape
# XLSX & JSON output

I made this application because I could not find any exhaustive databases of readily-formatted information about the elements. (I need such a database for another project I am working on)

The application in this repository downloads the full Periodic Table of the Elements according to all of the current data available for each element according to Wikipedia, and creates both a nicely formatted Excel file and a usable JSON database file.

1) First, a full list of elements is scraped from: http://www.lenntech.com/periodic-chart-elements/atomic-number.htm

2) Then, the data for each element taken from there will be pulled from Wikipedia.

3) The data is processed, formatted, and output to an Excel workbook as well as a JSON database file.

Feel free to use it however you like, though Wikipedia may not appreciate this program being run several times in a row with short delay!
